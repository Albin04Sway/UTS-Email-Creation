# UTS-Email-Creation
Pretty simple project. Program asks for the users first name, last name, and department, and it generates a UTS email, a random password and the mail capacity. When asked for the department, if a user enters an invalid choice, the department menu repeats itself until a valid input.
It is still a work in progress as I wish to create a proper email log in/register system, and hopefully incooperate a User Interface as well.
